Welcome to BlogSite, a feature-rich, full-stack blogging application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform provides a seamless and intuitive experience for writers to share their stories and for readers to discover and engage with content. The application features a sleek, modern UI with a dark mode, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blogs, and interactive features like comments and likes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account or a local MongoDB installation.
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for image storage.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blogsite.git](https://github.com/your-username/blogsite.git)
    cd blogsite
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (`blog-backend`):**
    ```sh
    cd blog-backend
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `blog-backend` root directory and add the following environment variables:
      ```env
      MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
      CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
      CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
      CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
      ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend (`blog-frontend`):**
    ```sh
    cd ../blog-frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - In your first terminal, navigate to the `blog-backend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    - In your second terminal, navigate to the `blog-frontend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

The frontend is configured with a proxy in `vite.config.js`, so any API calls to `/api` will be automatically forwarded to your backend server.
