![BlogSite Screenshot](![alt text](image.png))

Welcome to BlogSite, a feature-rich, full-stack blogging application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform provides a seamless and intuitive experience for writers to share their stories and for readers to discover and engage with content. The application features a sleek, modern UI with a dark mode, full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blogs, and interactive features like comments and likes.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for sign-up and sign-in, ensuring that users can only modify their own content.
- **Rich Text Editor**: A clean and simple interface for writing and editing blog posts.
- **Image Uploads**: Seamless banner image uploads for blogs, powered by Cloudinary for scalable cloud storage.
- **Interactive Engagement**: Users can like posts and leave comments to interact with authors and other readers.
- **Dynamic Filtering & Searching**:
    - Filter blogs by category.
    - Search for blogs by author.
    - A dedicated "My Blogs" view to see only your own posts.
- **Persistent Dark/Light Mode**: A beautiful, animated theme toggle that remembers the user's preference across sessions using a React Context and `localStorage`.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first design that looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.
- **Toast Notifications**: Sleek, non-intrusive notifications for actions like successfully deleting a blog.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account or a local MongoDB installation.
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account for image storage.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blogsite.git](https://github.com/your-username/blogsite.git)
    cd blogsite
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (`blog-backend`):**
    ```sh
    cd blog-backend
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `blog-backend` root directory and add the following environment variables:
      ```env
      MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
      CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
      CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
      CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
      ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend (`blog-frontend`):**
    ```sh
    cd ../blog-frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminal windows to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    - In your first terminal, navigate to the `blog-backend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    - In your second terminal, navigate to the `blog-frontend` directory.
    - Run the development server:
      ```sh
      npm run dev
      ```
    - The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

The frontend is configured with a proxy in `vite.config.js`, so any API calls to `/api` will be automatically forwarded to your backend server.
